# -TheDress
This repository contains the complete set of data collected during the experiments described in: <br/>
•	Lafer-Sousa, R., & Conway, B. R. (2017). #thedress: Categorical perception of an ambiguous color image. Journal of Vision <br/>
•	Lafer-Sousa, R., Hermann, K., L., & Conway, R., B. (2015). Striking Individual Differences in Color Perception Uncovered by 'the Dress' Photograph. Current Biology 25, R1–R2. <br/>

Processed data and Analysis code (Matlab) to quantify some of the main findings and generate figures will also be deposited here.  Code to generate Figures 1, 2, and 7 from (Lafer-Sousa, R., & Conway, B. R. (2017) is currently provided.  

The stimuli used in our experiments are provided in the STIMULI folder . An additonal subdirectory therein contains an unpublished stimulus: a 'dress tile' (made from a portion of the dress image) that can be placed in any scene (we demonstrate this using Beau Lotto's cubes, but a file containing the isolated tile is also provided). We suspect this will be a useful tool for researchers looking to use #theDress to test hypotheses about the cues/mechanisms that support color constancy. 

The RAW DATA folder contains excel spreadsheets of our raw data. The file ‘DATA_SHEET_KEY.xlsx’ provides details on the data contained in each sheet (additional details are provided in ‘SuppInfo_LaferSousa2015CB.pdf’).  The file ‘DATA_SHEET_KEY.xlsx’ provides details on the data contained in each spreadsheet (additional experimental details are provided in ‘SuppInfo_LaferSousa2015CB.pdf’) <br/>
